# Comparison-of-performance-between-Federated-learning-and-personalized-models

## Abstract
With the development of artificial intelligence technology, there are many references to the importance of data security
as a basis for learning. In this paper, we designed the MNIST classification model using two conventional centralized
learning algorithms and federated learning algorithms (FedAvg, CFL). It shows the research direction of next-generation
machine learning for performance comparison and data privacy protection by classification time and accuracy.
